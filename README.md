# OpenCourseAPI

An open-source API to scrape, process, and serve college course and class data 📒

(Also, a fresh take on [OwlAPI](https://github.com/OpenCourseAPI/OwlAPI) =D)

## Features

- 🔍&nbsp; Scrapes **terms, departments, courses, and classes**
- 🧩&nbsp; **Campus-agnostic architecture** allows easy extensibility
- 📅&nbsp; Currently serves **10+ years** of just FHDA data
- 🏫&nbsp; Scrapes a total of **4 colleges** (adding more is just a matter of time)

**Coming Soon:**

- 📙 Scrape **course catalogs** to get more course info, such as descriptions
- 🔗 **Link classes to professors** for advanced analytics
- 🌐 **GraphQL API** (proof-of-concept finished)


## **Data Explorer => [opencourse.dev](https://opencourse.dev)**

_URL is subject to change.. but for now, the frontend and the API are hosted on the same domain._


## API Docs

Currently, the following data for the following campuses exists:

| id | name |
| --- | --- |
| `fh` | Foothill College |
| `da` | De Anza College |
| `wv` | West Valley College |
| `mc` | Mission College |

All endpoints (except for `/:campus`) support the following query parameters:

| name | format | default |
| ---- | ------ | --- |
| `year` | a valid year | 2020 |
| `quarter` | `fall`, `winter`, `spring`, or `summer` | fall |

Example: [/da/depts?year=2019&quarter=fall](https://opencourse.dev/da/depts?year=2019&quarter=fall)

#### `GET /:campus`

Example: [/fh](https://opencourse.dev/fh)

## Examples

### Python

Install `requests`, and use the API as follows:

```python
import requests

API_URL = 'https://opencourse.dev'
req = requests.get(f'{API_URL}/fh/courses')

if req.ok:
    courses = req.json()

    for course in courses:
        print(course['dept'], course['course'], course['title'])
```

</details>


## Development

For running the API server, install `python` 3.8, `pip`, and `pipenv`.

Note: the following is subject to change (especially the scraper modules)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenCourseAPI/OpenCourseAPI.git
cd OpenCourseAPI

pipenv install # install all python dependencies

python -m campus.fhda.fhda_scrape # scrape Foothill / De Anza College
python -m campus.wvm.wvm_scrape # scrape West Valley / Mission College

python server.py # start the server
```

To run the frontend, install `Node.js` (preferably v12+) and `yarn`. Afterwards, run the following:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install # install NPM packages
yarn start # start dev server
```

To build for production, use:

```bash
yarn run build
```

The generated static files are in `frontend/build`. To run a static server to serve the built files, use:

```bash
yarn run start:static
```

To run tests, use the following:

```bash
yarn test # run all tests
yarn test:e2e # only run end-to-end tests
```
